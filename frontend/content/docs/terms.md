</p>

## Summary

<p>
As detailed in our <a target="_blank" href="https://mindhive.science/docs/about">About</a> page, MindHive is an online platform that hosts a collection of human brain and behavior citizen science projects. MindHive supports a network of (1) students & teachers who seek authentic STEM research experiences, (2) scientists (in neuroscience, cognitive science and/or psychology) who seek to address their research questions outside of the lab, (3) community-based organizations who seek to carry out grassroots research for policy change, and (4) members of the community who wish to contribute data by participating in our studies and learn about human brain and behavior research.
</p>

<p>
We value you and the time you invest and want to make sure you understand that we will not abuse your contributions. In the text below, including the legal details, and in our <a target="_blank" href="https://mindhive.science/docs/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, you can read in detail how you can use our platform, what kind of data we collect, how we handle and protect your data, and how we expect you, the user, to handle and protect data stored on our platform.
</p>

<p>
By agreeing to use the MindHive platform, you allow us and our collaborators to use your data responsibly and within the terms outlined in this agreement.
</p>

## How we handle and protect your data on MindHive

### 1) Your participation is voluntary

<p>
Your participation on Mindive is completely voluntary, and you may discontinue your participation at any time, for any reason. You may end your participation in any study by closing your browser window. If you have an account on MindHive, you are free to request the deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting <a href="mailto: info@mindhive.science">info@mindhive.science</a>. Note that we only have control over data that is stored with us at the moment of request. Some data may be beyond our control (e.g., data that has already been shared with researchers or included in publications, or data that cannot be retrieved because you forgot your username).
</p>

### 2) We will never sell your data

### 3) We take great care to protect your identity

<p>
Only anonymized or <em>de-identified</em> data will be visible to researchers and educators. That means that by default, your data will exclude any identifying information like your name, email address, etc., unless you give explicit consent to researchers or educators to access your data.
</p>

### 4) Your de-identified data can be used for research and educational purposes

<p>
When you contribute data to MindHive, your (<strong>fully anonymized</strong>) data may be used to (a) address any research questions, (b) illustrate brain and behavior concepts in classes and lessons, and (c) help improve user engagement in the platform. <strong>You will be able to customize these default settings on your Account page.</strong> We do not allow commercial use of your data.  
</p>

## General Data Protection Regulation

<p>
For all data stored on our platform, we adhere to the EU <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> where possible. This is one of the strictest data protection laws out there, put into place in 2018, and we are committed to applying it to all users, across the globe. Therefore, even if you are using MindHive in the United States or another country where data protection laws may be less strict, these terms apply to you.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Researcher and Educator accounts will be vetted by the MindHive team before being activated and will only be granted to individuals affiliated with an academic institution or registered educational or not-for-profit organization. Students accounts can only be created under the supervision of Educators.
</p>

a) <strong>Participants</strong> contribute data by participating in MindHive studies and tasks. Participants are encouraged but not required to register an account with MindHive. Having an account provides additional benefits to both participants and researchers. For example, you won’t have to fill out the same questions each time you go to MindHive, you can review results and updates about the studies and tasks you have previously taken part, and you can receive updates when new or follow-up studies are available.

b) <strong>Researchers</strong> can (a) host studies, tasks, and resources on MindHive, (b) collect data on MindHive, and (c) access de-identified data collected on the platform. For access to identifiable data, researchers are expected to abide by regulations put in place by their host institution (e.g. obtain IRB approval for data collection).

c) <strong>Educators</strong> can (a) host studies, tasks, and resources on MindHive, (b) collect data on MindHive, (c) access de-identified data collected on the platform, and (d) add students to the platform. Educators can grant access to de-identified data collected on the platform to students for educational purposes at their own discretion.

d) <strong>Students</strong> can explore and participate (see Participant) in MindHive hosted studies and tasks, and develop their own studies and tasks (see Researcher). Students will only have access to data collected from studies for which they are co-owners. Student accounts can only be created as part of a class, using a class code provided by an Educator.

### Changes to the Terms and Conditions

<p>
The legal environment and the legal details by which we operate and make your data available can change. When this happens, we need to obtain your permission to move forward.  However, if you give us the broad permissions that are outlined in this agreement, we can quickly adapt to these circumstances and make the necessary legal changes without obtaining permission from every single user.  
</p>
<p>
In sum, by engaging with MindHive, you agree that your de-identified data may be shared with authorized Users (Researchers and Educators) and be used for research and educational purposes. Only non-commercial use of your data will be allowed: we will never ever sell your data to anyone. Finally, you can request that your data be removed from the platform at any time by contacting <a href="mailto: info@mindhive.science">info@mindhive.science</a>.
